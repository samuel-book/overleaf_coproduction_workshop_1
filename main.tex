We can model key changes to pathway:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What if the pathway were faster?
    \item What if hospital determined the stroke onset time in more patients?
    \item What if clinical decision-making was like that of \emph{benchmark} hospitals? (Predict what treatment a patient would receive at other hospitals).
\end{itemize}

We accessed 240,000 emergency stroke admissions in England and Wales over three years.

\frametitle{Explaining model predictions with SHAP values}

SHAP values show the influence of features (even for \emph{`black box'} models).

\footnotesize{Note: SHAP values here are \emph{log odds}. Each value of \textpm 1 changes the chances of receiving thrombolysis about 3-fold. \\}

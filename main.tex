\frametitle{Breaking down the emergency stroke pathway into key steps}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{./images/pathway}
\end{center}
We can model key changes to pathway:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What if the pathway were faster?
    \item What if hospital determined the stroke onset time in more patients?
    \item What if clinical decision-making was like that of \emph{benchmark} hospitals? (Predict what treatment a patient would receive at other hospitals).
\end{itemize}

We accessed 240,000 emergency stroke admissions in England and Wales over three years.

\begin{frame}{Model accuracy, and simplification}

Our machine learning models use XGBoost classification, and are based on all patients who arrive within 4 hours of known stroke onset.

            \item Arrival-to-scan time

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Key findings}
General observations about thrombolysis use: The chance of receiving thrombolysis is increased by:
\emph{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shorter arrival-to-scan times
    \item Mid-level stroke severity
    \item Precise onset time
    \item Lower pre-stroke disability
\end{itemize}
}

\vspace{5mm}

Lower thrombolysing units are particularly less likely to give thrombolysis to patients with:
\emph{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Low or high stroke severity
    \item Higher pre-stroke disability
    \item Estimated onset time
\end{itemize}
}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Possible questions for discussion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Does anything surprise you here?
    \item What are your attitudes to mild strokes and patients with estimated stroke-onset times?
    \item What might you do with the knowledge that different hospitals have different attitudes to mild strokes and patients with estimated stroke-onset times?
    \item Why do you think pre-stroke disability appears influential in thrombolysis decision-making?
\end{itemize}
